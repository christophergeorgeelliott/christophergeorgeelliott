Hello, my name is Chris and I am brand new to the coding world.  I recently retired from the Navy and started a new path in coding.\
I currently am in my junior year of college and just finished up a Python course and a online python tutorial.\
So I am looking for entry level projects to better hone my skills and build my resume.

Thanks for reading.
